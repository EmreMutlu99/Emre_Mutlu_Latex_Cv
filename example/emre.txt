01/09/2025 – 01/10/2025

Ollama-Agent-Kit

Ollama Agent Kit is an open-source Node.js toolkit for building memory-enabled AI agents powered by Ollama. It
supports conversation threads, lightweight JSONL memory, and tool calls (e.g., weather, time, reservations), making it
easy to integrate LLM agents into your own projects.Write here the description...

System-Logger-Microservice
In a production environment, event logs must be recorded. Some companies do this by saving events to text files,
while others have their own logging systems in place. This project is a plugin-based solution that stores event logs in a
database and provides a front-end interface.Write here the description...

01/06/2025 – 10/06/2025

Digital-Image-Fault-Detection-Demo
Surface Defect Detection Demo — Textile Production
This repository contains a supervised deep-learning demo for pixel-level defect segmentation in industrial textile
images.
A U-Net model, trained on manually labeled data, predicts surface anomalies. The demo includes a Flask web app
where you can upload an image and instantly view the predicted defect mask side-by-side with the original.

IOT-Smart-Button-ESP8266
This project was intended to be a low-power, Wi-Fi-connected open-source IoT button, designed primarily for use in
environments like restaurants, shops, or offices as a simple "Call Me" or "Request Assistance" button.
